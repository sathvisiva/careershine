					At the core of Career Shine Academy’s educational delivery methodology is the state-of-the-art Interactive Onsite Learning (IOL) model developed by Hughes Global Education. Students attend classes being beamed in real time through satellite. Live video of action at the institute’s classroom is captured on camera and transmitted live to all Hughes centers throughout India. The lecture being conducted by the institute faculty members is thus relayed in remote classrooms created through dedicated broadband two-way audio-visual equipment. The technology has several benefits over face-to-face teaching. Students can use a virtual raise hand-feature seeking-teacher's attention and tabulate responses to quizzes randomly created by the teacher. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The methodology enables peer-to-peer collaboration among students. Students can discuss about projects within a centre or across different centres. It also enables individual assignments to students.
